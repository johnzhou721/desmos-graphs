# desmos-3d-graphs
Some of my Desmos Graphs. Maintained in DesModder Text Mode BETA format.  ``.desmos`` files are just plain text files, not any format.

## Usage

Install DesModer, Go to https://www.desmos.com/3d, Click the DesModer button, Core -> Text Mode BETA -- ON, click on the T icon, paste in the plain text comments from .desmos files. .desmos is not an actual file format, just use it as plain text.

Animate the t or t_ime variables.

Note: Roughness of branches is a rendering error. No real roughness is implemented. The snow drops are stopped using a conical plane that approximates the bottom branches but is not exact, so expect rare floating snowdrops.

## rockets.desmos

Various forms of rockets etc. that are NOT accurate models. Lots of rendering issues from a far distance, and due to banned compound inequalities workarounds have to be made w/ square roots to restrict range.

## notebook.desmos

Something that resembles a notebook shape.  Linear equations only, as it was for a school project.
