# desmos-3d-graphs
Some of my Desmos Graphs. Maintained in DesModder Text Mode BETA format.  ``.desmos`` files are just plain text files, not any format.

## Usage

Install DesModer, Go to https://www.desmos.com/3d (or /calculator if the graph is 2D), Click the DesModer button, Core -> Text Mode BETA -- ON, click on the T icon, paste in the plain text comments from .desmos files. .desmos is not an actual file format, just use it as plain text.

Animate the t or t_ime variables.

Designer graphs uses Actions on the left to perform... actions.


## treesnow.desmos (3D)
https://www.desmos.com/3d/87ffrwptsd

Note: Roughness of branches is a rendering error. No real roughness is implemented. The snow drops are stopped using a conical plane that approximates the bottom branches but is not exact, so expect rare floating snowdrops.

## rockets.desmos (3D)
https://www.desmos.com/3d/2r18v5g1vb

Various forms of rockets etc. that are NOT accurate models. Lots of rendering issues from a far distance, and due to banned compound inequalities workarounds have to be made w/ square roots to restrict range.

## notebook.desmos (2D)
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/36bbfefc4a

Something that resembles a notebook shape.  Linear equations only, as it was for a school project.

## palace-designer.desmos and icepalace.desmos (2D)
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/evzjjcxrge and https://www.desmos.com/calculator/0qaurut1xd

Unofficial fanart inspired by Disney's *Frozen* (2013).  The designer / first link has utilities to create new pillars.

(Note: $\frac{\mathrm d}{\mathrm dx}\tan x=\sec^2 x$ may explain some things.

## pumpkin.desmos (3D)
https://www.desmos.com/3d/fq6mbo4bgp

A pumpkin graphed with Desmos.  A LaTeX program that produces a .STL file model is accessible at https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/209935/740697#740697.

## wheel.desmos (2D)
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/aabdc57e0e

Lots of wheels nested and spinning inside each other.  This was originally used by a very competitive math contest participator at my school as a show-off to me, given that he bashed and baked in all the algebra into the equations; however, this remake by me uses more Desmos syntax flexing, and I didn't do any algebra by myself.

## wristband.desmos (2D)
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b5eb14493d

A graph of a wristband.  I know, we're all tired of these when going to events.

## bezier-designer.desmos (2D)
https://www.desmos.com/calculator/11b7064caa

A very simple tool to draw cubic beziers in Desmos.  No handle "snap"/tangent support between pieces, handles are piecewise only.

## waterdrop.desmos (3D)
https://www.desmos.com/3d/f0f9301e7a

A quite unrealistic simulation of water drops.
